**urtRAD**, a Remote Administrative Database (and interface) for Urban Terror 4.1 servers.

Currently its just a prototype, but it provides logging and search of player data to assist in management of the server.

Additional features are planned and some are partially implemented.

More information and [screenshots](http://code.google.com/p/urtrad/wiki/Screenshots) can be found in the [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/urtrad/w/list).

Please note this project is no longer under active development as I don't have the time to continue it. (Also, I no longer play much Urban Terror)
